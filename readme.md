<h1>Forms; A math library written by a math enthusiast</h1>

<h2>Why <em>Forms</em>?</h2>
As I was developing, I often found I wanted my inputs and outputs to be of the form...well, "of the form...". The name just kinda stuck. I also find that rephrasing math statements and equations using "of the form..." verbiage allows for a more intuitive perspecive about what the math is really trying to say behind all of the jargon. y=mx+b? More like "y is something of the form mx+b", "y 'looks like' mx+b". (I couldn't exactly take 'looks')

<h2>Okay but <em>why</em> Forms?</h2>
I've always wanted to work in both math and computer science; this may be a chance to do so simultaneously! It also should (hopefully) improve precision issues that are all to common with floating point numbers.

<h2>What Forms?</h2>
A Form is a template of sort, directly a mathematical expression which gives you a general template on how a large or possibly infinite situation may be resolved.

<h2>Example Forms?</h2>
For example; The cartesian product of the sets {x | x%2=0} and {1,3,5} is a set where all elements are <bold><em>of the form</em></bold> {(2k,1),(2k,3),(2k,5)}
